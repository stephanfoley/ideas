### üß† What I Can Access

I can search and retrieve abstracts, citations, and links from the following types of sources:

- **Open-access repositories** like:
  - *SSRN (Social Science Research Network)*
  - *Law Review Commons*
  - *Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ)*
  - *PubMed Central* (for health and bioethics topics)
  - *arXiv* (for technical and AI-related papers)

- **University-hosted law reviews and journals**, including:
  - Harvard, Yale, Stanford, Columbia, and many others
  - Most law schools you listed earlier publish their journals online

- **Academic search engines and aggregators**:
  - *Google Scholar* (I can search for articles indexed there and link to open versions)
  - *Semantic Scholar*
  - *Scijournal.org* and *Paperpile* (curated lists of databases and tools)
  - *Scribendi‚Äôs list of free journal databases*

### üîç What I Can‚Äôt Access Directly

I don‚Äôt have full access to **paywalled databases** like:
- *JSTOR*
- *HeinOnline*
- *Westlaw* or *LexisNexis*
- *Scopus* or *Web of Science*

However, I can often find **open versions or summaries** of articles from those platforms hosted elsewhere (e.g., university repositories, SSRN, or author websites).

### ‚úÖ What You Can Ask Me To Do

- Find academic articles on a specific topic (e.g., ‚ÄúAI and copyright‚Äù or ‚Äúonline contracts in tech‚Äù)
- Provide full citations, abstracts, and direct links
- Summarize key themes across multiple articles
- Format results for citation tools or export

Just give me a topic or a few keywords, and I‚Äôll start pulling together high-quality academic sources.
